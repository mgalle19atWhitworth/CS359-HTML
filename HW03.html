<p style = "text-align:center;"> Ji's Editorial: On September 27, 2017, a volcano has erupted in the Republic of 
  Vanuatu, which is an island nation located in the South Pacific Ocea. Vanuatu has 
  sparked an unprecedented evacuation of an entire island. All 11,000 residents of 
  Ambae have been told to leave and will be moved to other islands in the Pacific 
  state. The Manaro Voui volcano, which has been rumbling for days, began spewing 
  ash in a "moderate eruption" over the weekend. Officials had moved 6,000 residents 
  to shelters elsewhere on Ambae earlier this week, but have now ordered a full-scale 
  evacuation. All islanders are expected to have been moved off Ambae by next Friday, 
  in what emergency officials said would be a first for the country.

  A supermarket at London University is going to be the first store in the world to allow customers to pay with their fingerprint instead of a credit card. There are some advantages to moving to paying with your fingerprint nevertheless, there are also disadvantages. You won’t have to carry your credit card or cash with you or even remember a pin to your debit card. Also it is a lot more secure because it is a lot harder to get someone’s finger print then the pin to their debit card. However there is one big glaring problem going this route. What if you cut your finger and the reader can no longer read your finger print? Then you wouldn’t be able to pay for groceries. While they say the fingerprint reader should be able to work with wet, dirty or even small cuts this doesn’t include burning your finger when cooking or even deep cuts will cause the fingerprint reader to not recognize your fingerprint. There is also the cost for companies having to put in the equipment for reading fingerprints and most companies have changed to the chip reader in the fast few years meaning most of the companies might not want to pay for the fingerprint readers.    
	You won’t be able to forget your fingerprint at home which is a big advantage to moving to fingerprints. It would be a lot faster checking out because you wouldn’t have to put your pin in or even sign for you items because you fingerprint would be your pin and signature. Stealing someone’s fingerprint is a lot harder then stealing their credit card, debit card, or cash. Fingerprints would be a lot safer. As long as you can still use a credit card in case you do cut or burn your finger then this method of payment could work. There will still be a need for cash though because most small business classes might not be able to afford fingerprint readers. Overall this could be a good idea because the technology is already there, being used on most smartphones and even some computers. If the fingerprint reader technology is affordable then there could be more companies following London University.
