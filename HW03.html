<p> Ji's Editorial: On September 27, 2017, a volcano has erupted in the Republic of 
  Vanuatu, which is an island nation located in the South Pacific Ocea. Vanuatu has 
  sparked an unprecedented evacuation of an entire island. All 11,000 residents of 
  Ambae have been told to leave and will be moved to other islands in the Pacific 
  state. The Manaro Voui volcano, which has been rumbling for days, began spewing 
  ash in a "moderate eruption" over the weekend. Officials had moved 6,000 residents 
  to shelters elsewhere on Ambae earlier this week, but have now ordered a full-scale 
  evacuation. All islanders are expected to have been moved off Ambae by next Friday, 
  in what emergency officials said would be a first for the country.
