New figures released by London Mayor Sadiq Khan show every area in the 
capital exceeds World Health Organisation (WHO) limits and are toxic air particles which can increase the likelihood of respiratory 
and cardiovascular diseases. Children exposed to toxic pollutants are more likely to develop reduced lung function and develop asthma 
in later life, while PM2.5 is also known to result in 29,000 premature deaths in the UK every year, the Committee on the Medical 
Effects of Air Pollutants said. Around half of the fumes/particles in London are from sources outside the city, however, the main 
sources of the particle emissions in the capital are from tyre and brake wear on road vehicles, construction and wood burning.

Personally, this is alarming to me, considering that I will be in London in January. The possibility of me not being able to breathe 
clearly is quite disturbing. This issue can be resolved if they fix the roads or make tires that are compatible to the type of tar or
material they use. Also, I am not sure why they burn wood that causes fumes, but if the burning was reduced, it would help out as well. 
Hopefully by the time I get there, the fumes and particles will be slim to none. </font>

McKenna's Editorial:
  A supermarket at London University is going to be the first store in the world to allow customers to pay with their fingerprint instead of a credit card. There are some advantages to moving to paying with your fingerprint nevertheless, there are also disadvantages. You won’t have to carry your credit card or cash with you or even remember a pin to your debit card. Also it is a lot more secure because it is a lot harder to get someone’s finger print then the pin to their debit card. However there is one big glaring problem going this route. What if you cut your finger and the reader can no longer read your finger print? Then you wouldn’t be able to pay for groceries. While they say the fingerprint reader should be able to work with wet, dirty or even small cuts this doesn’t include burning your finger when cooking or even deep cuts will cause the fingerprint reader to not recognize your fingerprint. There is also the cost for companies having to put in the equipment for reading fingerprints and most companies have changed to the chip reader in the fast few years meaning most of the companies might not want to pay for the fingerprint readers.    
	You won’t be able to forget your fingerprint at home which is a big advantage to moving to fingerprints. It would be a lot faster checking out because you wouldn’t have to put your pin in or even sign for you items because you fingerprint would be your pin and signature. Stealing someone’s fingerprint is a lot harder then stealing their credit card, debit card, or cash. Fingerprints would be a lot safer. As long as you can still use a credit card in case you do cut or burn your finger then this method of payment could work. There will still be a need for cash though because most small business classes might not be able to afford fingerprint readers. Overall this could be a good idea because the technology is already there, being used on most smartphones and even some computers. If the fingerprint reader technology is affordable then there could be more companies following London University.

McKenna's Second Editorial:
A Welsh life science startup called Digital Health Labs has created a platform Metalyst to help analyze clinical trial data. It will help speed up the process of deciding which treatments are the best for the patient. The platform includes will help with golabal collaboration in the study of cancer and other life threating diseases. Digital Health Labs won the “Dragon’s Den” completion at Biowales 2016. The Dragon’s Den is where startups will pitch there ideas to a panel of six “Dragons” who decide which startup to fund. Biowales is a convention held in Cardiff about the new advances in life science. This is because Cardiff has the most life science companies in the UK. Winning the “Dragon’s Den” will help Digital Health Lab because the get money for winning to put towards Metalyst, and also they get press so their company name gets out there.

Drew's Editorial: Music Venues in the UK<br />
	The music scene in the UK is going on strong, with more people than ever attending live music concerts and festivals.  According to The Guardian (Ellis-Peterson), crowds have increased in size by 12% over the last year, which helps pump 4 billion pounds into the UK economy.  Music tourism itself has grown by 20% in the last year as well.  Bigger venues are thriving alongside the music scene in general, but smaller venues have been struggling to survive.
	The biggest venue in the UK is in Pilton, England, and it holds a large five-day festival called the Glastonbury Festival.  It’s considered to be the largest greenfield festival in the entire world, with over 175,000 people turning out.  As big of an event as it is, all the staff working the festival are volunteers, so most of the money made is given to different charities.
	Another well-known venue in the UK is the O2 arena in London.  It’s the second largest indoor arena in the United Kingdom, housing nearly 20,000 people at max capacity.  It does, however, boast itself as the world’s busiest music arena, racking up over two million tickets sold in 2008.  They beat out another popular venue, the Manchester Arena.  
	The Manchester Arena is the largest indoor arena in the UK, and hosts sporting and music events.  It can hold up to 21,000 people when full.  Unfortunately, the arena had been closed from May until September due to a suicide bomber at an Ariana Grande concert who killed 22 people and injured 250 more.  It reopened on September 9.
	As for smaller music venues, life has been rough.  Smaller, but well-known venues like the Cockpit in Leeds and the Sheffield Boardwalk have had to close.  The cause behind these closures comes from a multitude of reasons.  Rent prices have be skyrocketing and licensing issues have been plaguing many of these venues.  Also, property developers have been taking over these venues and destroying them, with no regard to the cultural importance of smaller music venues.  In turn, smaller bands are having a tough time getting known, which could lead to an interesting change in the UK music scene for the worse.
